# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is when you create save files like checkpoints in your code so you can always roll back to a previous version. This is useful if there is a problem with code, you can always go bach to a version that works.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a version of a code that is modified somehow that you can work on without affecting your original code until you're ready to merge the new changes.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is when you save the code that you have into your repository. A good commit is clear and tells what that change does.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when you try to merge a new branch to the original, or master, but changes have been made to both branches.
