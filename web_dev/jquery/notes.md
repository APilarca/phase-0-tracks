I would first go to google and try to understand exactly what jquery was. After that I would try to understand how to execute my new knowledge. Breaks are important to give yourself time to really think about and prcoess the things you just learned.
It seemed best for me to make sure if I didn't completely understand something I spent a little more time on it.
